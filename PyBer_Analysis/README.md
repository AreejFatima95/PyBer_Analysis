# PyBer_Analysis
Pyber -Ride sharing app - Data by city type.

The cities were divided into 3 categories -
Urban
Suburban
Rural

Multiple factors were compared to analyse the data which were as follows:
Total Ride,
Total Drivers,    
Total Fares,    
Average Fare per Ride,    
Average Fare per Driver.

Overall the earnings from Urban rides had roughly double  earnings as that from Suburban rides and thrice as much compared to Rural rides.This was true at any given day of the month.Although the "average fare per ride" was the highest in Rural areas and so was the "average fare per driver" and the lowest in the Urban areas.


The contributing factors could be the scarcity of driver is in Rural areas with a total of 78 driver as compared to 2405 drivers in Urban areas.

The overall gross earnings were higher in Urban areas as there wwere more rides.
There was also a slight increase in rides in Rural area where there was a reduction in Urban areas in certain weeks. It could probably be due to an influx of people visiting urban areas on long holidays or school breaks and so on.

I would recommend the following:
Increase the number of drivers in Rural areas
Reduce the fares in Rural areas
Increase the fares in Urban areas so the earnings per driver increase.
